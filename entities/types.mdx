# Creating Types

In manage mode, click on '\+ New' in the left hand sidebar, and select 'Type'.

<img

  alt="Screen Cast 2025-06-25 at 2.49.48 PM.gif"
  title="Screen Cast 2025-06-25 at 2.49.48 PM.gif"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"86%" }}
/>

You can then choose the _purpose_ of your type from the following options.

- Objects
- Documents
- Work Done
- Files
- Scripts
- Charts

Selecting one of these options is an **optional** short cut, and applies defaults to the type settings. If you do not want any defaults applied, you can create a 'Custom' type.

# Customising your Type

## Content

The content of your entity is what you will see on the page when you open a template or instance of this type.

| Content type | Description                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Page Content | Information that exists on a page                      |
| Script Code  | Script                                                 |
| Chart        | Visualisation                                          |
| File         | An uploaded file, eg. a Word Document, PDF, Excel file |
| none         | No document or page content                            |

## Type Fields

- Here you can add fields that should exist for **all** entities of that type. e.g. Date Created, Created By, Effective Date.
- Any entities of this type that do not have this field will show a warning. This also applies to pre-existing entities, if you are making edits to the type and add a field.

  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"64%" }}
/>

  alt="Screen Cast 2025-06-20 at 12.18.03 PM.gif"
  title="Screen Cast 2025-06-20 at 12.18.03 PM.gif"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"58%" }}
/>

## Status Tags

All entities have status tags, and these are different depending on whether the entity is published or in draft.

By default, all entities have the following status tags:

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-08-27at13.52.37.png"
  alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 13.52.37.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 13.52.37.png"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"66%" }}
/>

These can be edited on the type for both templates and instances. Not only can you change the text and colour - you are also able to add further options for each status.

<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-08-27at13.53.08.png"
  alt="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 13.53.08.png"
  title="Screenshot 2025-08-27 at 13.53.08.png"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"68%" }}
/>

Status tags of drafts can be changed from the top bar of the entity. the status tag of the upcoming published version can be changed from within the change set.

<img
  src="/images/Seal(11).gif"
  alt="Seal (11).gif"
  title="Seal (11).gif"
  className="mx-auto"
  style={{ width:"100%" }}
/>

#### Creating custom Status Tags on the fly

As you can see in the GIFs above, there is an option when selecting a status tag to `+ New status tag` . This allows you to make a new custom Status Tag while working. Any Status Tags made on the fly will **not** become options in other entities of the same type. If you wish to add a new option for the whole type, that should be done in the type settings.

## Review Requirements & Checks

You are able to set mandatory review requirements and checks that must pass in order for templates and instances of this type to be published. These requirements can be different for templates and instances.

## Instance settings

In addition to the above, for instances, you can choose whether:

- Unique titles should be enforced across instances
- Version numbers are relevant (eg. for instances representing pieces of equipment, you may not care about the version number)
- Users should be able to select the active version, or if it should always be the latest

# Converting between Types

Entities can be converted between compatible Types.

- Click on the 3 dot menu in the top right corner and click convert
- Select a new Type, and click convert
- The change in Type will be reflected in the right hand sidebar

<img
  src="/images/ScreenCast2025-08-27at2.10.06PM.gif"
  alt="Screen Cast 2025-08-27 at 2.10.06 PM.gif"
  title="Screen Cast 2025-08-27 at 2.10.06 PM.gif"
  className="mx-auto"
/>

This provides the user with greater flexibility when adapting to changing requirements.
