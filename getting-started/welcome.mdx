## Seal:GxP-Compliant Workflows in minutes, not months

### Why Seal

Regulated industries have always faced a forced compromise: sacrifice speed for the sake of compliance. This dilemma leaves innovative teams dependent on rigid software or paper-based systems that lock away critical data, prevent automation, and fundamentally stifle the pace of innovation.

Seal is the adaptive GxP platform built to end that compromise. Instead of trapping you in static processes, our low-level, AI-powered foundation is designed to evolve alongside your operations. This core adaptability, combined with absolute GxP control, is why it's the last system you will ever need.

### Understanding the Platform Structure

Our platform is built on a simple yet powerful concept, with 3 different types of entities: **Types -\> Templates -\> Instances**. This structure allows for both standardization and flexibility, ensuring compliance while enabling rapid innovation.

#### Types: The rules of your setup

"Types" are the fundamental, version-controlled data models that define the **rules** of your entities. These rules get applied to all entities of that type eg. are unique titles enforced? Types are standardized and reusable across your entire organization, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

#### Templates: The building blocks of your process

"Templates" are where you build on types, making templates for Instances. Template's behaviour gets **inherited** by instances on their creation. This means if you make a change to a template, it will _only be reflected on instances made from that new template version_.

#### Instances: Executing your workflows with precision

An "Instance" is a single, executable run of a template. It's the **actual thing**. When a scientist in the lab starts a new experiment, they create an instance of the relevant template. This instance is a complete, auditable record of the process, with all the data captured in a structured and compliant manner. Each instance is a unique, time-stamped event, providing full traceability.

## Achieving compliance with Seal

All types, templates and instances are what are known as "_Entities_". In order for an entity to be published, it has to go through a **change set**. Change sets are reviewed before being published, and can also undergo automatic validation via scripts. For example, a script could ensure that no fields have been left blank, while the reviewer checks that the operators answers are sensible.

Review requirements can be set for instances and templates to ensure that nobody can publish certain entities without the correct person approving them.
