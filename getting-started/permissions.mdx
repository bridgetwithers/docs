## Manage mode

Manage mode is for building up the platform structure. It  is the processes of creating a standardised format that provides a framework for capturing and organising data about a particular workflow.

In manage mode, you are able to create and edit types, templates and instances. Enabling you to set up the platform, including workflows, review processes and data ingestion systems to name a few.

Those with manage permissions can use the platform in either manage or operate mode.

## Operate mode

Operate mode is for carrying out the work set up by the managers.

In operate mode, you can create and edit instances. You are also able to create and respond to review requests.

Those with operate permissions are not able to enter manage mode
